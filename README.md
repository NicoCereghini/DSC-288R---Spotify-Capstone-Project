### :fire: Steps to Run :fire: :rocket:

1. Ensure "security_details.json" is in the dataset folder. The tokens here are REQUIRED to fetch any data from the database or create compute for the silhouette score computation.
2. Go to the notebooks folder. <b>The following notebooks are ok to run:</b>

- eda.ipynb
- baseline-models.ipynb
- k-means.ipynb
- SoM.ipynb

<b> \*\*You must run all the cells in order for each notebook. Running cells out of order raises a high chance that things will break!\*\*</b>

For a demo of the sihlouette score calculation, simply run the "distributed_sihlouette.py" file.
